# Deep Learning Journal Article Review and Implementation

This is a Project completed for my Deep Learning course in Florida Atlantic University's Professional PhD program.

There are 2 main folders in this repository: 

1) STGAT_Original (which is an exact clone of the directory from the journal article)
2) STGAT_YFinance (which is my version of the code base)
   a) I replaced the proprietary stock database to Yahoo Finance
   b) I had to create a handful of files that are referenced in the original code that do not exist in the original repository
